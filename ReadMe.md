# Deep Learning Study

## Mask R-CNN
> More than ten weeks ago, I joined a research project. One goal of this project is exploring a machine-learning algorithm that would be used for segmenting the urban building instances from aerial images. At last, Mask R-CNN was adopted by our team.

> In this project, My majority task is image augmentation. However, this project influences my interest in the deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks.
