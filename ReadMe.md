# Immersed In Leetcode
>**A man in his fifties aspired to shift his career from being a skilled industrial automation engineer with expertise in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) to a data engineer. He has been diligently utilizing Leetcode for more than two months now to assist him in securing a job in this field.**

According to the roadmap for a data engineer, the fundamental technologies that need to be mastered are Python (or R) and SQL. Therefore, when practicing coding problems on LeetCode, there are mainly two directions:
a. Use Python to become familiar with algorithms commonly encountered in interviews.

  Common algorithms: 
  1. Recursion/Backtracking
  1. DFS/BFS: Especially in Graph(Tree) Traversal or Topological Sorting
  1. Binary Tree/Binary Search Tree
  1. Dynamic Programming
  1. Sorting (Merge sort/quickly sort): Binary Search/Divide and Conquer
  1. Special Data Structure: Hash table/Queue/Stack/Heap
  1. Pointer Manipulation: Two pointers/Sliding Windows

b. Choose MySQL to become proficient in SQL.
