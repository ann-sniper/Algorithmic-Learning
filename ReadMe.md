# Immersed In Leetcode
>**A man in his fifties aspired to shift his career from being a skilled industrial automation engineer with expertise in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) to a data engineer. He has been diligently utilizing Leetcode for more than two months now to assist him in securing a job in this field.**

According to the data engineer's roadmap, I must first master Python, so I used Python to solve special algorithm problems often encountered in the following interviews:
1. Recursion/Backtracking
1. DFS/BFS: Especially in Graph(Tree) Traversal or Topological Sorting
1. Binary Tree/Binary Search Tree
1. Dynamic Programming
1. Sorting (Merge sort/quickly sort): Binary Search/Divide and Conquer
1. Special Data Structure: Hash table/Queue/Stack/Heap
1. Pointer Manipulation: Two pointers/Sliding Windows
